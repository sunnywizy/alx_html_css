#üåê TechCon 2024 Static Website Project

##üåü Overview

This project is a multi-page static website built for the fictional "TechCon 2024" conference. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of foundational HTML5 and CSS knowledge, focusing heavily on semantic structuring, form design, table presentation, and adherence to web accessibility standards.

The project is structured into five core, interconnected pages, ensuring consistency and clear navigation across the entire site.

###üìÅ Website File Structure

The project consists of the following five HTML files, each demonstrating specific web development concepts:

File Name

Description

Key HTML/CSS Focus

index.html

The main landing page, featuring the conference title, navigation, and an embedded promotional video.

<h1>, <header>, <main>, <nav>, <footer>, <video>

about.html

Details on the conference history, mission, and notable past speakers.

Semantic Structuring (<article> for distinct topics), <img> with alt attributes.

schedule.html

Presents the detailed conference timetable and session lineup.

HTML Tables (<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, <td>).

register.html

A user-friendly form for attendee sign-up and data collection.

Forms (<form>, <input>, type="email", type="checkbox").

contact.html

Contact information, social links, and an embedded map of the venue.

Multimedia Embedding (<iframe>), mailto: links.

##üéØ Learning Objectives Mastery

This project successfully helped me master the following core web development concepts, which I can now explain without external resources:

What is CSS: Understanding its role in styling HTML elements.

How to add style to an element: The different methods (inline, internal, external).

What is a class: Defining reusable styles for multiple elements.

What is a selector: How CSS targets specific HTML elements for styling.

How to compute CSS Specificity Value: Understanding the hierarchy and rules the browser uses to decide which style rule wins.

What are Box properties in CSS: Knowledge of the Box Model (Content, Padding, Border, Margin).

How does the browser load a webpage: The process from fetching the HTML to rendering the final page (DOM and CSSOM).

##üõ†Ô∏è Requirements & Constraints

W3C Validation: All HTML code must pass validation checks to ensure compliance with W3C standards.

No External Libraries: The website is built using only pure HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. Frameworks, libraries, or external packages (e.g., Bootstrap, React, VueJS, Node.js) are strictly prohibited.

File Structure: A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.

Line Endings: All files end with a new line.

##üöÄ Usage

To view the website:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the project folder.

Double-click the index.html file to open the homepage in your web browser.
